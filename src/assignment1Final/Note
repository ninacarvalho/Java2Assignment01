this is the final version that combines everyone's work
Remaining questions:
1. Everyone review the code and give suggestion 
  - Should we add or reduce comments to the code
  - I can't decide whose code should be used for TestClass2
2. I suggest each of us take responsibility for 2 classes

Once the final code is settled, the next steps:
  1. Video part 1: run the programs, this doesn't need to record audio and can be done by one
  2. Word document 1: screenshots of output
  3. Video part 2: each one records a video explaining the classes we chose (mentioned before)
  4. Combine video parts 1 and 2
  5. Word document 2: A word/ text file which will reflect on learning of your concepts in this Assignment Also include the instructions on how to run your code.
